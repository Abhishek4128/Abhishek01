Q1.Difference between compiler and interpreter? compiler-A compiler is a program that translates the entire source code (written in a high-level language) into machine code in one go, before execution. interpreter-An interpreter processes the source code line by line and executes it immediately without producing a separate executable file. Some interpreters convert source code to an intermediate form (like bytecode) and execute that.

Q2.Difference Between = and ==? "=" is used to assign the value to any variable "==" is used to compare the variable to the value

Q3.How many types of range functions are there to use in loops? range(stop):with a single argument it starts from 0 till not including stop before the stop ex:for i in range(3) it gives values 0,1,2 range(start,stop):it starts from start and end before the stop ex:for i in range(1,6) it gives the values 1,2,3,4,5 range(start,stop,step):it starts from start and ends before the stop and increments by step ex:for i in range(1,15,3) it gives the values 1,4,7,10,13 if we want to count from backwards we will use for i in range(15,1,-3) it gives the values 15,12,9,6,3.

Q1.Difference between break and continue statements? Break:break terminates the program according to the condition ex:for i in range(1,15) if we give the condition if i==5 then break then the output will be 1,2,3,4. Continue:continue only skips the value given in the condition and print the remaining as same ex:for i in range(1,7) if the condition is if i==3 then itb gives the output 1,2,4,5,6.

Q2.Explore about %d,%f,%s,%t,/n? %d used for the digit values,%s used for string values,%t used for tab values,/n is used for new line or next line,%f used for floating point numbers.
